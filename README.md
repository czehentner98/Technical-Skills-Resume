Created a web resume for technical skills using markdown and html.
  This leveraged different skills such as html programming, uploading and inserting images, and commiting updates to the master branch. Most of my focus in creating this template was placed on taking the Jekyll template and customizing it. Github has a set of standard themes for webpages, so I was able to find the html file for the "architect" theme and make personal changes from there such as: adding my headshot and personal information to the sidebar, changing the default header (my repository name) to a customized title and subtitle, and formatting text within the body of the page. 
  
   The biggest issue I ran into was getting the headshot image to appear on the page. It was my understanding that in order to get an image to appear in Github, I would have to have the image in my repository and format the source based on its location within my repository. After several failed attempts at getting this to work, I tried adding the web address of the image as the source and the picture began showing up on my page.
