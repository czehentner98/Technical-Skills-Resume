This training helped familiarize me with the GitHub platform as whole while exposing me to fundamental tools such as pull requests, commits and merges. I learned how to collaborate with others (rather than simply upload and edit my own code) and utilize my personal respositories to maintain things like this technical resume. GitHub will prove extremely useful in the future for building pieces of more complex systems and referring to public examples of solutions when necessary. Here is a list of the courses I took:
    
 <ul>
  <li>Communicating using Markdown</li>
  <li>Uploading projects to Github</li>
  <li>GitHub Pages using HTML</li>
  <li>Managing merge conflicts</li>
  <li>Reviewing pull requests</li>
  <li>Securing your workflows</li>
</ul> 
Here is proof of completion:

I audited the Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Power BI course available on edX. PowerBI provides a cloud-based platform to clean data, integrating Excel and other applications when necessary to provide real-time analytics and assist in decision making. The following modules taught me methods to transform and interpret various data types and how to strategically utlilize them for visualization on a dashboard or published report.
    
 <ul>
  <li>Managing Data Transformations on the PowerBI Desktop Application</li>
  <li>Desktop Modeling</li>
  <li>Data Visualizations</li>
  <li>Online PowerBI Service</li>
  <li>Excel Data Imports and Direct Connectivity</li>
</ul>

To practice the skills I obtained in this course, I created a dashboard to model 'New Hire Demographics' for Sample HR data. To see the dashboard in action, click on the image below:

Completing the AWS Essentials course on Linux Academy introduced me to the core AWS services and the process of setting up my own AWS account, applying new concepts to real-world scenarios. The course utilizes an example project called "Project Omega" that helps walk through and demonstrate a lot of the features that the AWS platform has to offer, which I found very beneficial and applicable. It really opened my eyes to the endless resources and capabilities AWS users have and helped me understand the "why" behind so many organizations moving towards it. Here is a list of the courses I took:
    
 <ul>
  <li>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</li>
  <li>Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</li>
