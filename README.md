I completed the "Day One" and "Week One" introductory Github courses through the official Github website. At its most basic level, Github allows for version control of programs and projects through the process of committing changes to new branches and then merging those branches to the master branch once they are complete and functional. Through my training on Github, I am able to use pull requests, commits, and merges to collaborate with others on code, as well as use Markdown in conjunction with html to create and host pages on Github. Here is a list of the courses I completed:

 <ul>
  <li>Communicating using Markdown</li>
  <li>Uploading projects to Github</li>
  <li>GitHub Pages using HTML</li>
  <li>Managing merge conflicts</li>
  <li>Reviewing pull requests</li>
  <li>Securing your workflows</li>
</ul>

To practice the skills I learned in these courses, I created and maintained this technical skills resume on Github using markdown and html. This leveraged different skills such as html programming, uploading and inserting images, and commiting updates to the master branch. Most of my focus in creating this template was placed on taking the Jekyll template and customizing it. Github has a set of standard themes for webpages, so I was able to find the html file for the "architect" theme and make personal changes from there such as: adding my headshot and personal information to the sidebar, changing the default header (my repository name) to a customized title and subtitle, and formatting text within the body of the page.

I took the Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Power BI course available on edX. PowerBI is a business analytics platform that can import data from many different sources (including Excel, ???, and blank) and give users the ability to create interactive data visualizations, reports, and dashboards. Through my training in PowerBI, I am able to create simple charts and dashboards as well as utilize some of PowerBI's more advanced features such as navigation pane/dashboard customization, customized featured questions, Quick Insights Generator, and specialized PowerBI charts and graphics. Here is a list of the courses I completed:
    
 <ul>
  <li>Managing Data Transformations on the PowerBI Desktop Application</li>
  <li>Desktop Modeling</li>
  <li>Data Visualizations</li>
  <li>Online PowerBI Service</li>
  <li>Excel Data Imports and Direct Connectivity</li>

<span style="font-family:futura; font-size:1.5em;">Skills & Training</span>


I completed the AWS Essentials course on Linux Academy as an introduction to core AWS services. I created and managed the security of my own AWS account using IAM and got exposure to many of the other features AWS has to offer such as bulk storage and object versioning/lifecycling in S3, SQL/non-SQL based database services in RDS and DynamoDB (respectively), and cloud computing instances with EC2. Through the training's use of an overarching example (referred to as "Project Omega"), I also understand how these services can be used in conjunction with one another to create solutions to a vast array of professional issues. Here is a list of the courses I took:    
 <ul>
  <li>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</li>
  <li>Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</li>
  <li>Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)</li>
  <li>Storage Services (S3)</li>
  <li>Databases</li>
  <li>Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)</li>
  <li>Auto Scaling</li>
  <li>Route 53</li>
  <li>Lambda</li>
  <li>General AWS Account Management</li>
</ul>

I completed the PowerShell 5 Essential Training through LinkedIn Learning. Powershell is a shell designed for task automation and configuration management. While this can be a powerful and complex tool, this training taught me that accessing most of its features lies in being able to use the "get-help" command effectively. With development of this skill, I was able to research command syntax as well as find information on things like module installation, csv and xml file imports and exports, and script writing in ISE. Here is a list of the courses I completed:   
 <ul>
  <li>Initializing and Customizing PowerShell</li>
  <li>Discovering Commands and Getting Help</li>
  <li>Working with Snap-ins and Modules</li>
  <li>Using Pipelines</li>
  <li>Using Objects</li>
  <li>Scripts and Automation</li>
  <li>Scalable Management and Remoting</li>
</ul>
