<summary>Created a web resume for technical skills using markdown and html.</summary>
  This leveraged different skills such as html programming, uploading and inserting images, and commiting updates to the master branch. Most of my focus in creating this template was placed on taking the Jekyll template and customizing it. Github has a set of standard themes for webpages, so I was able to find the html file for the "architect" theme and make personal changes from there such as: adding my headshot and personal information to the sidebar, changing the default header (my repository name) to a customized title and subtitle, and formatting text within the body of the page. 
  
   The biggest issue I ran into was getting the headshot image to appear on the page. It was my understanding that in order to get an image to appear in Github, I would have to have the image in my repository and format the source based on its location within my repository. After several failed attempts at getting this to work, I tried adding the web address of the image as the source and the picture began showing up on my page.

# AWS
### Skills:
Developed familiarity with:
<details>
<summary>IAM</summary>
  - IAM allows you to create user accounts to use the same aws services with you. The five main steps to activate IAM are: deleting root access keys, activating multi-factor authentication key on the root account, create individual IAM users and designate permissions/access on the basis of what they need, use groups to assign permissions, and apply a password policy
</details>  
<details>
<summary>VPCs</summary>
  -  A VPC is a private subsection of AWS that you control and put resources into. This is the equivalent of having your own private facebook profile (others can only access it if you give them access). Your VPC also provides internet to AWS. NACL (Network Access Control Lists) are essentially user defined "firewalls" where the user defined the rules for inbound and outbound traffic to the VPC.
</details> 
<details>
<summary>EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)</summary>
  -  EC2 creates a vm desktop computer within AWS, allowing you to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security, and manage storage. To launch an EC2 Instance INCLUDE STEPS HERE
</details>  
<details>
<summary>AWS Storage Services/S3</summary>
  - S3 is an online bulk storage service that allows the stored items to be accessed from any device. Objects are stored in S3 buckets, and files can be created and stored in these buckets to help organize objects. To decrease latency, choose the region closest to you for your bucket. S3 also allows object versioning and lifecycle management.
</details>  
<details>
<summary>Database Services</summary>
  -  AWS offers two services for the creation of databases: RDS (based on SQL) and DynamoDB (not based on SQL). RDS Databases are stored on private subnets, but ssh tunneling allows EC2 instances to connect these databases to the internet so they can be used. 
</details> 
<details>
<summary>Route 53</summary>
  - Can register a domain name via the AWS DNS server.
</details> 
<details>
<summary>Lambda</summary>
  - Creates application code without having to run on a server. Will eventually replace EC2 instances.
</details> 
<details>
<summary>General AWS Account Management</summary>
  -SNS lets users create their own "topics" to receive notifications about; whenever a specified event occurs, an email or text message can be sent to any user who subscribes to the SNS messages. AWS also offers several account management tools like CloudWatch and CloudTrail. CloudWatch makes monitoring AWS resources easy by calculating useful metrics for service usage and these metrics can in turn be used to trigger actions, like alarms.
